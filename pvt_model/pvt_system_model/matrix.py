"""
The matrix coefficient solver for the PV-T model.

The model works by arranging the system of differential equations as a matrix equation
such that the temperatures at each time step can be computed based on the coefficients
of the matrix which are computed based on the temperatures of the various components at
the previous time step, as well as various Physical and fundamental constants.

The equations in the system can be expressed as the matrix equation
    A * T = B
where
    A is the matrix computed and returned by this function;
    T is a vector containing the various temperatures;
    and B is the "resultant vector," computed elsewhere.

The equations represented by the rows of the matrix are:


The temperatures represented in the vector T are:
