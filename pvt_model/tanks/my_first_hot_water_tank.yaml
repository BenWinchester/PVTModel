# The mass of water held in the tank, in kilograms. This roughly corresponds to the
# capacity of the tank in litres.
# Increased after a Google Search - 02/12/2020
mass: 150 # [kg]
# The area of a typical tank is used in this example:
# This is measured in meters squared.
area: 1.9 # [m^2]
# @@@ This could be extended to be temperature dependent
# The heat-loss coefficient is measured in Watts per meter squared.
heat_loss_coefficient: 3 # [W/m^2]
# The heat-transfer coefficient is the product of the heat-loss coefficient and
# the area of the tank
heat_transfer_coefficient: "{heat_loss_coefficient} * {area}"
